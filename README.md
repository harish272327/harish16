## 📌 Project Title
**Delivering Personalized Movie Recommendations with an AI-Driven Matchmaking System**

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an AI-powered movie recommendation system that delivers personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences, viewing history, and behavioral patterns using machine learning algorithms such as **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

## 🧠 Overview
This project utilizes AI techniques to predict and recommend movies that a user is most likely to enjoy based on past interactions, ratings, and movie features. The system integrates both **Random Forest** and **SVM** to classify user preferences and make accurate predictions, providing a personalized experience on movie streaming platforms.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user behavior
- AI-driven matchmaking system using **Random Forest** and **SVM**
- Scalable design to integrate with movie platforms
- Easy-to-use implementation on **Google Colab** for experimentation and deployment

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
- Contains:
  - User ratings of movies
  - Movie metadata (genres, titles, etc.)
  - Tags and descriptions

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**, **Surprise**, **TensorFlow** (for deep learning models)
- **Google Colab** for easy deployment and experimentation
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🤖 Algorithms Implemented
- **Random Forest Classifier** – to classify user preferences based on historical ratings and features
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** – for finding decision boundaries and classifying user behavior
- **Collaborative Filtering** – item-based and user-based recommendations
- **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends movies based on their characteristics

## 🚀 Deployment
- Implementation and testing are carried out on **Google Colab** for rapid prototyping.
- Future plans include deploying the model as a **web application** using **Flask** or **Streamlit**.

## 👥 Team Members
This project was created by the team under the **Naan Mudhalvan** initiative.

- **S. Harish**
- **S. Hemanath**
- **S. Hameed Ibrahim**

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add a user feedback loop to refine recommendations in real time
- Integrate real-time movie data using APIs from platforms like IMDB or TMDb
- Add NLP techniques to analyze user reviews for sentiment-driven recommendations
